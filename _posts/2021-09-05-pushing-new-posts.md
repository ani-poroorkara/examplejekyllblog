We are almost there!! The last final stage of publishing your post is to push your post onto Github. You guys must be already familiar with this so I'll just leave the code here :)

```console
git commit -m "Pushing the new post"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/ani-poroorkara/examplejekyllblog.git
git push -u origin master
```
